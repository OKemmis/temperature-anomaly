# temperature_anomaly

https://ottok-08042022.web.app

A Flutter project which renders the years from 1880 to 2021 as a sequence of colours, with shades of blue representing years with negative global temperature anomaly and shades of red representing years with positive anomaly. The user is able to see a clear visual indication that global mean temperatures are increasing, as the colours associated with recent years become more saturated shades of red.

The data I used for my visualisation was sourced from NOAA (the National Centers for
Environmental Information) and is available here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series. The parameters I used are as follows:
* Timescale: Annual
* Start Year: 1880
* End Year: 2021
* Region: Global
* Surface: Land and Ocean
